Utilized ensemble techniques such as bagging and boosting. The model incorporates Random Forest classifier, XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks, with a comparative analysis to determine the best fit among the three algorithms. The approach combines the strengths of multiple models to enhance predictive accuracy and fraud detection capabilities."
